## Veeam Service Provider Console Application Server for Self-Service Portal for Veeam Agents

In _Veeam Service Provider Console_, you can restore files and folders to their initial location or download restored data to your computer. When you perform a file-level restore, Veeam Service Provider Console displays the backup content in the **file-level restore portal**. You can browse the guest OS files and folders, restore them to original location and overwrite or keep original objects or download ZIP archive with restored objects to your computer. When you restore guest OS files and folders, Veeam Service Provider Console connects to the Veeam backup agent installed on remote computer which performs the restore process.
