## Description

The intuitive, fast, and beautiful cross-platform Git client. NOTE: GitKraken web site does not allow to download a specific version, so this package *always* downloads the latest one. Once installed GitKraken has its own auto-update. Unpredictable downloads is a reason why checksum verification is disabled. If you have strong arguments for adding checksums - let me know.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
